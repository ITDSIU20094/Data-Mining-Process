# Data Mining project

  We create this project for practicing in Data Mining. The purpose of this project is comparing 6 models. Include: IBK,NaiveBayes,OneR,ZeroR,SMO and RandomTree

  From a raw dataset on Kaggle, we did preprocessing dataset, EDA, in order to get list of result, which contains 20 element, representing 20 selected k-folds from 1 to 20. After visualizing them, we evaluate 6 models
